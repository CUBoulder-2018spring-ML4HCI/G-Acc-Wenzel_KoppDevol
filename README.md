# Accessible Vehicle Control Project

###### Max Wenzel and Eli Kopp-Devol

### Goals
* The goal of this project was to simulate the control of a "vehicle" or general method of transportation in a way that is accessible for someone with a dissability while still allowing that person to exersise part of their body. Specifically we wanted to use the flexing of different muscles to send various signals to the "vehicle" so that a person with control of any part of their body could still move about while exersising that part of their body. To do so we used a Myo armband to read EMG signals and mapped an outstretched flexed hand position to an impulse increase in velocity with constant decay. This allowed the user to increase velocity by repeatedly flexing their hand and then allowed them to stop rapidly by "breaking" their wrist (bent 90Ëš with fingers pointing down). The rotation of the arm controlls direction of travel. 

### Tools/Libraries
* Processing: A simple visualization of how a vehicle would respond to different inputs

* Myo Connect: To connect the Myo to PC

* Myo Mapper: Feature extraction and packaging of OSC messages to send to Processing


### Feature Extraction
* For this project we were able to use the Myo Mapper, available for free on the Myo website, to perform our feature extraction. The Mapper allows you to pick from a wide range of features to send over OSC, all of which are derived from its three sensors; the accelerometer, gyroscope, and EMG sensors. The features available to send over OSC ranged from just sending the raw data, to a scaled or averaged version of this data, all the way to a first order difference of any of the data. For our project specifically we only used the raw gyroscope data, to access the rotation of armband, and a scaled version of the EMG data to detect hand position/gesture (the raw data was too small for Wekinator to register).
